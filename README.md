## 1. Executive Summary

**Aegis / GigShield** is an AI-powered parametric insurance platform engineered exclusively for India's Q-Commerce gig economy (Zepto, Blinkit). By correlating real-time GPS streaming data (via Apache Kafka) with external APIs (IMD, CPCB), the platform automatically issues micro-insurance payouts via Razorpay UPI when uncontrollable environmental or operational disruptions halt a rider's income. 

Traditional insurance fails the gig economy because it measures payout via months of paperwork. GigShield measures payout in milliseconds. Built on a dynamically adjusted weekly premium model (₹45–₹105/week) powered by an XGBoost algorithm, GigShield protects the most vulnerable segments of the gig workforce against 100% income wipes caused by severe weather, high AQI, and app crashes, while successfully projecting a **₹3.09 Crore monthly operating profit**.

**Strict DEVTrails Constraint Checklist:**
- [x] **LOSS OF INCOME ONLY:** Strictly excludes health, life, accidents, or vehicle repairs.
- [x] **WEEKLY PRICING:** Matches the typical weekly payout cycle of a Zepto gig worker.
- [x] **PERSONA FOCUS:** Specifically targets Q-Commerce Delivery Partners.

## 2. Research Insights

Our foundational research identified the extreme income fragility of Q-Commerce workers, dictating every system architecture choice we made:

| Insight | Data Point |
|---|---|
| **Average Weekly Income** | ₹6,000–12,000/week on Q-Commerce platforms. |
| **Delivery Frequency** | 30–50 deliveries/day forced by aggressive 10-minute SLA models. |
| **Weather Sensitivity** | Q-Commerce demand drops by ~55% when rainfall exceeds 64mm (unlike food delivery, grocery is highly deferrable by consumers). |
| **Dark Store Density** | Riders are locked into a 2–5 dark store hyper-local radius (2-3km grid). If their zone floods, they cannot shift to another zone. |
| **Savings Buffer** | ~75% of delivery riders operate with less than 1 week of emergency savings. |
| **AQI Disruption** | Delhi PM2.5 AQI exceeds 300 on 60+ days/year. GRAP Stage III forces delivery platforms to halt outdoor dispatches. |

---

## 3. Problem Statement & The Crisis

Q-Commerce riders earn strictly per-delivery without the safety net of tips or restaurant wait bonuses. Because deliveries are scheduled in 10-minute windows, every single disrupted hour costs a Q-Commerce rider exponentially more than a traditional food delivery worker. 

A 2-hour rainstorm that disrupts a Zomato rider's 3-delivery window destroys a Zepto rider's 10–12 delivery window. There is no "come back later" for 10-minute grocery delivery guarantees. When the rain falls, the API dispatch drops to zero, and the rider earns nothing.

---

## 4. Target Persona: Q-Commerce Delivery Partners

We rejected a generic "gig worker" persona to build highly accurate, geo-fenced parametric triggers specifically for the uniquely vulnerable Q-Commerce sector.

> **Persona Profile: Arjun / Meena**
> - **Age & City:** 19–35 years old; operating in Tier-1 Metro dense corridors.
> - **Monthly Income:** ₹25,000–50,000 (Weekly: ₹6,000–12,000).
> - **Platform Lock-in:** Zepto (50%), Blinkit (35%), Swiggy Instamart (15%).
> - **Daily Workflow:** 30–50 micro-deliveries per day strictly within a 2-3km hyper-local dark store grid.
> - **Device Context:** Smartphone (90%+ primary device); 100% app-dependent.
> - **Core Pain Point:** Heavy rain or app downtime during a 2-hour peak window wipes out ₹600–900 of earnings with zero recourse.

---

## 5. Platform Choice Justification

**Decision: React Native Mobile App (iOS + Android)**
A mobile-first approach is mandatory. We are insuring workers whose entire operational existence lives on a dashboard 6 inches from their face. A React Native app uniquely provides:
1. **Continuous Background GPS Tracking:** Essential for validating if the rider is physically inside the affected dark store zone when the disruption hits.
2. **Biometric Native KYC:** Aadhaar facial verification and cryptographic device fingerprint logins are required to counter fraudulent claims at onboarding.
3. **Real-time Push Notifications:** Delivering instant payout alerts when SLA windows close ("Income Protected: ₹840 credited").

---

## 6. Solution Overview (The 3-Minute Payout Flow)

When a disruption occurs, GigShield activates its fully asynchronous architecture (200–500ms pipeline latency) designed to bypass human adjusters entirely:

1. **DISRUPTION OCCURS:** e.g., Tuesday 7 PM — Heavy Rain in HSR Layout, Bangalore.
2. **DUAL VALIDATION:** 
   - External: IMD confirms >64.5mm rain in the exact lat/long grid.
   - Internal: GPS shows Arjun has a 65% exposure overlap inside the Blinkit dark store catchment.
3. **MULTIPLIER ENGINE:** Base payout (₹1,200) is automatically mathematically multiplied by severity (1.0x) and duration (0.7x).
4. **FRAUD CHECK:** The Isolation Forest model calculates an anomaly score. (Score: 0.28 — Passed).
5. **INSTANT PAYOUT:** Tuesday 7:03 PM: ₹840 credited via Razorpay over UPI directly to the rider's bank.

## 7. The "Market Crash" Defense Strategy (Core Fraud Engine)

We recognized early that the biggest threat to a highly automated parametric insurance platform is an organized adversarial attack. We designed this architecture specifically to survive the Guidewire DEVTrails hackathon scenario: **a fraud ring fielding 500 fake GPS riders to drain the liquidity pool simultaneously.**

To mathematically protect our ₹6.45 Crore monthly payout pool, we deploy a ruthless 4-Layer system:

### Attack Vector 1: The "500-Node Simulated Syndicate" (The Market Crash)
- **The Attack:** A malicious ring uses emulators to create 500 fake accounts, spoofing their GPS to a Bangalore dark store grid and claiming an AQI disruption simultaneously.
- **Defense Step A (Graph Networking & Collusion Detection):** The API Gateway logs incoming JSON payloads. Our Graph Engine automatically clusters requests by shared **`/24` IP subnets** and mathematically hashes device fingerprints. The system instantly realizes that 500 claims are originating from only 2 IP subnets and 3 shared device emulators. The Graph Engine triggers an immediate freezing of the entire cluster.
- **Defense Step B (Immutable Time Locks):** Hard policy architecture dictates you cannot purchase a policy today and claim today. Accounts must be mature. All 500 emulator nodes < 48 hours old are automatically hard-rejected at the PostgreSQL DB level.
- **The Result:** ₹2.5 Lakhs in fraudulent payouts are blocked in approximately 800 milliseconds. Zero payouts are distributed. 

### Attack Vector 2: GPS Teleportation & Spoofing Apps
- **The Attack:** An individual authentic rider uses a location-spoofing app to simulate overlapping with a heavy-rain dark store grid while physically remaining at home.
- **Defense (Geographic Anomaly Engine):** The GPS velocity checker measures milliseconds between lat/long streaming updates over Kafka. If a rider updates from Zone A to Zone B requiring a velocity of >120km/h (Teleportation jump), the validation fails. We securely cross-validate this via cell-tower triangulation bounds (±500m logic). The spoofed location is thrown out by the Isolation Forest.

### Attack Vector 3: Fake Weather API Injection
- **The Attack:** A bad actor attempts to perform Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks or directly injects fake rainfall payloads to trigger the smart contract artificially.
- **Defense (Multi-Source Immutable Consensus):** We mandate complete multi-source agreement. The IMD (Primary) and OpenWeatherMap (Secondary) APIs must independently verify the exact JSON parametric payloads (protected by strict cryptographic hash verification). A single hacked endpoint cannot trigger the engine. Cross-referenced against 10-year baseline historical sanity checks ("AQI 450 in monsoon season" is auto-rejected).

By isolating behavioral anomalies (spikes in claim hours) via an **Isolation Forest ML algorithm**, GigShield's fraud walls make a systemic run on the liquidity pool architecturally impossible.

## 8. Trigger Selection Rationale

Every trigger was specifically chosen because it objectively halts 10-minute SLAs. They are measurable publicly, non-falsifiable by individuals, and mapped to extreme precision grids. We actively excluded Vehicle Repair and Health events as they require subjective human claiming.

---

## 9. Environmental Triggers

Our environmental triggers map perfectly to Q-Commerce pain points where atmospheric conditions force dark stores to suspend 10-minute API dispatch rules.

### 1.  Extreme Heat Trigger `EXTREME_HEAT`
- **Why Q-Commerce:** Zepto/Blinkit riders make 30–50 short outdoor trips per day. At 45°C+, NDMA guidelines advise against outdoor work 12–4 PM. Platforms reduce dispatch. Each lost hour = 5-8 lost deliveries.
- **Condition:** Temperature ≥ 45°C | Duration ≥ 6 consecutive hours | GPS overlap ≥ 60%.
- **Data Sources:** IMD (primary) + OpenWeatherMap (secondary, ±2°C tolerance).
- **Validation Logic:** `IF (IMD_temp >= 45 AND OpenWeather_temp >= 45) AND (temp_maintained >= 6 hours) AND (worker_gps_overlap >= 0.60) THEN approve_payout()`

| Temperature Range | Multiplier | Base Payout (6-hour window) |
|---|---|---|
| 45–47°C | 1.0x | ₹800 |
| 47–49°C | 1.2x | ₹960 |
| 50°C+ | 1.5x | ₹1,200 |

### 2.  Heavy Rain Trigger `HEAVY_RAIN`
- **Why Q-Commerce:** Rain is the single biggest income killer. A Zepto rider cannot complete a 10-min delivery during heavy rain — the SLA itself becomes physically impossible. Platforms pause dispatch, meaning zero order assignments.
- **Condition:** ≥ 64.5mm/day (IMD standard) | GPS overlap ≥ 60%.
- **Data Sources:** IMD (primary) + OpenWeatherMap/IQAir (secondary, ±10mm tolerance).

| Rain Category | IMD Threshold | Multiplier | Base Payout (Per Day) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy | 64.5–115.5 mm | 1.0x | ₹1,200 |
| Very Heavy | 115.6–204.4 mm | 1.3x | ₹1,560 |
| Extremely Heavy | 204.5+ mm | 1.7x | ₹2,040 |

### 3.  High AQI Trigger `HIGH_AQI`
- **Why Q-Commerce:** At AQI 300+, Delhi and Mumbai platforms have begun voluntarily reducing dispatch under GRAP Stage III restrictions.
- **Condition:** AQI ≥ 301 (CPCB standard) | Duration ≥ 6 consecutive hours | GPS overlap ≥ 60%.
- **Data Sources:** CPCB (primary) + IQAir (secondary, ±20 AQI tolerance).
- **Frequency Cap:** Max 2 AQI payouts per week per worker (prevents gaming during prolonged winter AQI seasons).

| AQI Range | Category | Multiplier | Base Payout (6-hour window) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 301–350 | Very Poor | 1.0x | ₹500 |
| 351–400 | Very Poor+ | 1.3x | ₹650 |
| 401–500 | Severe | 1.6x | ₹800 |

### 4.  Flooding Trigger `FLOODING`
- **Why Q-Commerce:** Flooding blocks dark store access roads. A 2-km hyper-local zone can become completely gridlocked by one flooded arterial road.
- **Condition:** Zone flagged waterlogged/flood-affected | 2+ source confirmation | GPS overlap ≥ 60%.
- **Data Sources:** Municipal API/SMS alert (primary) + Twitter crowd signals / historical flood-zone overlays (secondary).

| Flood Severity | Multiplier | Base Payout (Per Day) |
|---|---|---|
| Partial waterlogging | 1.2x | ₹1,800 |
| Severe flooding | 1.8x | ₹2,700 |

### 5.  Zone Closure Trigger `ZONE_CLOSURE`
- **Condition:** Official government restriction (curfew, mapped lockdown, disaster, strike). Verified by Government notifications + News API.
- **Payout:** Partial Zone (1.3x multiplier = ₹1,950) | Full City Closure (2.0x multiplier = ₹3,000).

---

## 10. Operational Triggers

###  Platform Downtime Trigger `PLATFORM_DOWNTIME`
- **Why Q-Commerce:** App down = exactly zero income immediately. Unlike food delivery, there is no self-assignment fallback. A 15-minute outage during the 8–10 AM morning rush wipes out 7-10 deliveries.
- **Condition:** API success rate < 95% OR dispatch assignment failure > 10% | Duration ≥ 15 min during peak hours (8–11 AM, 6–10 PM).
- **Data Sources:** Zepto/Blinkit API monitoring + Status pages + Firebase Crashlytics.
- **The Engine Calculation:** Fully variable based strictly on time offline and severity of the database crash.
  `Variable Component = (Severity_factor) × (Worker_hourly_rate)`
  `Severity_factor = (100 - success_rate) × 10`
   *Example:* An 82% success rate → 180 factor × ₹35/hr = ₹63. 
   **Total Payout Setup:** Base (₹100) + Variable (₹63) = ₹163/worker for a short outage.

| Duration | Multiplier on Base |
|---|---|
| 15–30 min | 0.8x |
| 30–60 min | 1.2x |
| 60+ min | 1.6x |

---

## 11. Earnings-Based Trigger (`EARNINGS_FLOOR`)

To strictly adhere to the DEVTrails "Loss of Income" mandate, an Earnings Floor Trigger evaluates if a drop is genuinely catastrophic.

- **Condition:** Daily earnings drop ≥ 60% vs. a rolling 4-week baseline.
- **Crucial Gating Elements:** This trigger mathematically cannot activate independently. It must be gated by **at least one external disruption trigger (e.g. Heavy Rain)** and requires **≥4 hours of attempted app session activity**. 
- **The Result:** This maintains true parametric integrity. Riders cannot simply skip work on a sunny Tuesday, log 0 hours, and claim an earnings drop. The external API event (the gating parameter) must align with their internal app activity logs.

| Income Drop % | Multiplier | Base Payout (Additive Top-up) |
|---|---|---|
| 60–70% | 1.0x | ₹100 |
| 70–85% | 1.4x | ₹140 |
| 85%+ | 1.8x | ₹180 |

*(Example: Meena's baseline is ₹1,000/day. On a Heavy Rain day, she earns ₹380, hitting a 62% drop. She receives her Heavy Rain Parametric Payout [₹1,200] PLUS the Additive Earnings Floor Top-up [₹100] because she satisfied the 4-hour attempt gate, totaling ₹1,300 of protection).*

## 12. Income Impact Map

This maps why our payouts look the way they do based on market disruption economics:

| Trigger | Impact on Platform Vol | Rider Daily Loss | GigShield Payout Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy Rain (64.5mm+) | 50–65% Drop | ₹700–1,400 | ₹1,200–2,040 |
| Extreme Heat (45°C+) | 30–50% Drop | ₹350–900 | ₹800–1,200 |
| High AQI (300+) | 20–40% Drop | ₹250–700 | ₹500–800 |
| Flooding | 80–100% Drop | ₹1,000–2,000 | ₹1,500–2,700 |

*(Note: Q-Commerce volume drop figures are drastically higher than standard food delivery because impulse grocery is highly deferrable by end consumers).*

---

## 13. Dual-Layer Data Validation

All claims must pass strict two-factor parametric gates:
1. **Layer 1 (External Data):** IMD, OpenWeatherMap, CPCB, and platform status pages must independently confirm the event.
2. **Layer 2 (Worker Exposure):** Continuous background GPS must mathematically log >60% presence in the affected dark store catchment. 

**Smart Exception Logic:**
```javascript
IF (All zone workers show zero activity) AND (Municipal alert issued) AND (Blinkit dispatch volume = 0)
THEN approve_payout() even if worker is inactive. 
// If the platform itself stopped dispatching, rider inactivity is logically pardoned.
```

---

## 14. Multiplier Engine (Core Innovation)

Flat fixed payouts fail gig-workers. A 2-hour rainstorm hurts a top earner exponentially more than a part-timer. Our engine dynamically calculates exact losses using compound multipliers:

`Final Compensation = Base_Payout × Trigger_Multiplier × Duration_Factor × Worker_Factor × Stacking_Factor`

**Ex: Compound Trigger Calculation:** (Rain 70mm + AQI 380 + Zepto App Down = 3 triggers). Base ₹1,200 × Stacking (2.0x) × Low-Tier account (0.85x) = **₹2,040 Instant Payout.**

---

## 15. Weekly Premium Model & Financials

Our system categorizes an estimated market of **300,000 gig workers** into three risk zones, calculated by historical disruption events, cross-subsidizing the platform to maintain highly profitable margins.

### Zonal Pricing & Worker Distribution
| Zone | % of Workers | Weekly Premium (₹) | Coverage % | Affected Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Green** | 40% (120,000) | ₹45 | 50% | 2% |
| **Orange** | 35% (105,000) | ₹65 | 45% | 4% |
| **Red** | 25% (75,000) | ₹90 - ₹105 | 35% | 7% |

### Financial Viability Pipeline
The actuarial base cost of operating in a Tier-1 city (Delhi) accounts for 14 disruption events a year. We charge a mathematically calculated premium slightly offsetting standard loss risks. 
- Total Expected Monthly Revenue: **₹9.60 Cr**
- Total Expected Monthly Payouts: **₹6.45 Cr**
- Core Infrastructure Hosting (AWS Prod): **₹5.40 Lakhs**
- **Total Sustainable Operating Net Profit: ₹3.09 Crore per month**
*(The Red Zone operates at a calculated -₹0.60 Cr loss per month, perfectly cross-subsidized by the vast volume of Green/Orange profitability).*

---

## 16. AI/ML System Design

The entire platform runs on discrete, highly specialized Python (scikit-learn) ML microservices:

1. **Model 1: Dynamic Premium Calculator (XGBoost Regressor):** Runs every Monday at 6 AM, predicting unique weekly premiums per rider based on dark store location, 7-day IMD rain logs, and historical disruption counts. `[city_id, zone_id, month, disruption_count_12mo, income_tier, account_age_days, rain_forecast_mm_7d, aqi_forecast]`
2. **Model 2: Fraud Anomaly Engine (Isolation Forest):** Unsupervised model flagging real-time claim spikes against historical baselines. `[gps_score, claim_freq_7d, device_hash, ip_cluster_size, zone_simultaneous_claims, earnings_to_claim_ratio]`
3. **Model 3: Onboarding Risk (Random Forest):** Classifies riders into Low/Med/High fraud risk tiers at sign-up via historical device mappings.

---

## 17. Technical Architecture (AWS Production Target)

Designed for extreme resilience and horizontal scale. We completely bypass monolithic REST bottlenecks via an event-driven system backbone.

### System Flow
1. **Client / Device** (React Native) -> **API Gateway** (Express.js / GraphQL)
2. **Gateway** -> **Stream Processor** (Apache Kafka - tracking background GPS without blocking) -> **Feature / Event Service**
3. **Event Service** -> **ML Inference Service** (Evaluating the Isolation Forest against the specific JSON Vector)
4. **Anomaly Engine** -> **Alert / Payout Service** (Razorpay India-Native Integration)

### Core Data Contracts (JSON Representation)
Our Feature Vectors flowing over Kafka strictly mandate the following schemas to feed into the XGBoost algorithm:
```json
{
  "device_id": "string_hash",
  "velocity": "float",
  "acceleration": "float",
  "distance_delta": "float",
  "time_delta": "float"  
}
```

### Cost-Aware Infrastructure Matrix
To prove fiscal responsibility mapped back to our Financial overview:
- **Phase 1 MVP (₹15K–₹40K/month):** Self-Hosted utilizing FastAPI, local Nginx routing, internal Postgres, and single-broker Kafka setups.
- **Production Enterprise (₹5.40L/month):** AWS managed auto-scaling infrastructure: CloudFront Edge, AWS API Gateway, Lambda/EC2 clusters, Amazon SageMaker (for the XGBoost pipelines), Amazon RDS (ACID compliance), and Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK).

## 18. Workflow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Legitimate Payout — Arjun’s Monsoon Event 
- **Setup:** Arjun pays a ₹175 dynamically calculated premium on Monday. Policy becomes strictly active.
- **Trigger:** Tuesday at 7 PM, heavy rain strikes Bangalore. IMD records 72mm. OpenWeatherMap independently confirms 70mm (within allowable ±10mm drift range).
- **Validation:** Our Kafka stream acknowledges Arjun’s background GPS logged a 68% overlap inside the Blinkit HSR routing grid for the last 3 hours. Blinkit dispatch logs reflect zero volume assigned across that grid.
- **Execution:** The trigger fires. The AI pipeline runs the Multiplier Engine on a base of ₹1,200. Accounting for duration (0.7x) and standard severity, it calculates a value of ₹840. The Isolation Forest parses Arjun's transaction vector and returns 0.28 (Safe).
- **Settlement:** Tuesday 7:03 PM (within 3 minutes). The Razorpay service executes the payout. Arjun receives ₹840 via UPI, successfully acting as the perfect parametric parallel to his expected 50 disrupted micro-deliveries.

### Scenario 2: Market Crash Matrix — The Syndicate 
- **Setup:** A malicious syndicate mass-registers 500 fake accounts via emulators on Monday, attempting to simulate a severe thunderstorm disruption on a clear Tuesday.
- **Trigger Attempt:** The API Gateway receives 500 claims citing AQI 380 + Platform Outage in a deep Delhi zone.
- **Immediate Rejection:** Our Tri-Layer defense intercepts. The trigger engine rejects the event outright (True API polling dictates CPCB AQI is 162). Even if the syndicate successfully hacked the CPCB API, the database enforces the immediate 48-hour age lock, executing hard-rejections. Simultaneously, our Graph Engine maps the 500 fake users back to 2 `/24` subnets and 3 actual device fingerprints via cryptographic hashing, instantly issuing an administrative freeze. 
- **Settlement:** Zero transactions processed. The ₹6.45 Crore liquidity pool remains mathematically unbreached.
